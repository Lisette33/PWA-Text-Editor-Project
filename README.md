## Project Guidelines stated as:

## User Story

AS A developer

I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection

SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a text editor web application

WHEN I open my application in my editor

THEN I should see a client server folder structure

WHEN I run npm run start from the root directory

THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client

WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal

THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack

WHEN I run my webpack plugins

THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file

WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application

THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors

WHEN I open the text editor

THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage

WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window

THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB

WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it

THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB

WHEN I click on the Install button

THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop

WHEN I load my web application

THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox

WHEN I register a service worker

THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets

WHEN I deploy to Heroku

THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application

## Acknowledgment
I would like to thank the professor, TAs, and others who provided their helpful guidance.
